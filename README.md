__How to start development environment__

1. 

__How Gerrit workflow works__

1. Create a story on JIRA

2. Create sub-tasks for your story

3. Create a branch on Gerrit

4. Fetch the branch onto your local machine and check out to the branch

5. If you haven't finished a sub-task but want to commit to Gerrit as a patch, the first time you should use `git commit`, then name your commit message using the format of `JIRA_ID SomeFeatureDescription`, then use `git push origin HEAD:refs/drafts/WEB-1990_SomeFeature`, which would not trigger CI. (IMPORTANT: any subsequent commits to this patch should use `git commit --amend` because this would update the existing patch instead of creating a new one.

6. If you finish a sub-task, you can push it to Gerrit using `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/WEB-1990_SomeFeature`, which would trigger a CI run

7. When all your sub-tasks related to the story are complete, you can merge your branch into `the_frontier`, which is a release candidate branch

8. `the_frontier` branch will finally be merged into `master`
